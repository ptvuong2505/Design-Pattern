# Introduction

**Design patterns** are reusable solutions to common software design problems that help developers build cleaner and more maintainable systems. They provide templates for solving issues in object creation, structure, and behaviour. They improve code flexibility and scalability.

- Provide standard, proven solutions to recurring design problems.
- Improve code readability, reusability, and maintainability.
- Help developers follow best practices in software architecture.
- Reduce development time by avoiding reinventing solutions.

# Types of Software Design Patterns

## [1. Creational Design Pattern](Creational/README.md)

**Creational Design Patterns** focus on the process of object creation or problems related to object creation. They help in making a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. Creational patterns give a lot of flexibility in what gets created, who creates it, and how it gets created.

There are two main themes in these patterns:

- They keep information about the specific classes used in the system hidden.
- They hide the details of how instances of these classes are created and assembled.

## [2. Structural Design Patterns](Structural/README.md)

**Structural Design Patterns** focus on organizing classes and objects to build larger, efficient, and maintainable software structures. They simplify relationships, support code reuse, and help create scalable architectures.

There are two recurring themes in these patterns:

- This pattern is particularly useful for making independently developed class libraries work together.
- Structural Design Patterns describe ways to compose objects to realize new functionality.
- The added flexibility of object composition comes from the ability to change the composition at run-time, which is impossible with static class composition.

## [3. Behavioral Design Pattern](Behavioral/README.md)

**Behavioral design patterns** focus on the communication and interaction between objects, helping to manage how responsibilities are distributed and how objects collaborate. They improve flexibility and simplify complex control flows within a system.

- Facilitate clear communication and responsibility sharing between objects.
- Help manage complex workflows and control structures.
- Promote loose coupling and improve system flexibility.
